/**
 * Workspace routing model for the SAP Controller shell.
 *
 * The SAP Controller started life as a single "…" options sheet. It is now a
 * reusable workspace *shell*: the same portal, focus trap, escape handling and
 * body-scroll lock host either the legacy options surface (`"options"`) or a
 * focused configuration workspace selected from the radial action menu
 * (e.g. `"plugin-settings:lyrics"`).
 *
 * A route is a `category:target` string (the bare `"options"` route has no
 * target). Categories group routes by which workspace surface renders them.
 * Deliberately free of any engine/session/React imports so the routing model
 * can later be promoted into the seihouse-ui design system alongside the menu
 * data model.

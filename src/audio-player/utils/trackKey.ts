 * Falls back to a composite of title + artist + audioFile for tracks that
 * were created before `id` was introduced. The fallback is good enough for
 * small playlists but can collide at Vault scale (duplicate titles, shared
 * CDN URLs after normalisation, stems/mixes with similar names), which is
 * why setting `id` is strongly recommended for production use.

 * Conservative silence trimming for Automix Lite.
 *
 * Downloads a track, decodes it, and RMS-scans the first/last seconds for
 * near-silence so crossfades don't run through dead air. This is deliberately
 * simple amplitude analysis — no BPM, beat grids, or song-structure detection.
 *
 * Every failure mode (no Web Audio, CORS-blocked fetch, decode error, file too
 * large, timeout) resolves to `null`, which callers treat as "no trims": the
 * track plays from its natural start to its natural end exactly as it would
 * with Automix off.

 * - `seaCard`      — inline progress + an overlay SEICanvas that shows the
 *                    waveform behind a small trigger (Phase 4).
 * - `stickyBottom` — compact bar; ScrubberCanvas (progress), deep actions in its

 * menu (`PlayerSurfaceButtons` → `SEICanvasActionMenu`). It is independent of the

 * waveform (when peaks exist) vs. the plain progress bar. Spacious faces opt in;
 * compact list/bar faces stay on the progress bar for performance and legibility
 * (flipping one of them on later is a single boolean here).

 * Capability-driven (`PLAYER_FACE_CAPABILITIES.miniSidebar`, CompactPlayer
 * family): a compact face. `supportsSEICanvas: false`, so the canvas zone and its
 * left surface button are auto-hidden. `supportsScrubberCanvas: false` — the mini
 * mounts **no** scrubber; seeking lives on the shared StickyBottom master. It is
 * the only compact face with the contextual radial menu
 * (`supportsContextualActions`), which is also where skip/next now live (via
 * `showTransport`) — freeing the row for title/artist instead of a Next button.
 * `PlayerSurfaceButtons` reads the capability flags from the model, so passing
 * `surface` plus the transport wiring yields the correct menu.

 * An embeddable "SEA card" surface — a marketplace/album card with an overlaid
 * play button that plays its track in the global session. When its track is the
 * active one it shows live progress and a pause state, kept in sync with every
 * other skin through the shared engine.
 *
 * Capability-driven (`PLAYER_FACE_CAPABILITIES.seaCard`): a marketplace card.
 * `supportsContextualActions: false`, so it renders no contextual menu — taps on
 * the card are about previewing/playing the track, not deep actions. The inline
 * scrubber stays a plain progress bar; Phase 4 adds a small wave trigger on the
 * active card that opens the overlay `SEICanvasHost`, which shows the hero +
 * the interactive `WaveformAdapter` (`supportsWaveform: true`). No radial menu is
 * added — the card stays clean and tap-to-play.
